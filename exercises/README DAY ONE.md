# Read Me First #

This is the order to work through this material. The code is marked up for what you need to implement to understand how RMQ provides those patterns.

If an exercise is marked [Optional] then it does not come with a slide deck, but if you have extra time, feel free to look at it.  You may prefer to skip these, and return to them, if you have time.

## Precursors ##
