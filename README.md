# Practical Messaging

Material to support my Practical Messaging Workshop's exercises. Note that this folder is not open source i.e. copyleft, but feel free to clone, browse the material, consume it, and do the exercises, whether or not you have attended the associated course.

Please contact me if your company would like a private presentation of this material

I am very open with my course content for my workshops; I recognize that not everyone has an employer with a budget for them to travel and join others for the taught material, or works with me and gets to join a course for free. Whilst it is not the same as "being there" just in case it helps any of you, the material is in GitHub. It does get changed over time as I find better ways to express this.

I usually try a different thing every workshop, to see if some new ideas help folks. So there is likely to be a 'surprise' that is not in this material yet.

Lecture Content:

* You can find the content for both days here: https://github.com/iancooper/practical-messaging

Coding Exercises:

* The exercises in my Github under Practical-Messaging-X where X is the language name.
  * You can use C#, Java, Go, JavaScript or Python for the exercises
  * For example https://github.com/iancooper/Practical-Messaging-Sharp
* The exercise and solutions are in branches, not trunk
* On Day One the prerequisite is the ability to run Rabbit MQ.
* On Day Two there is one exercise using Kafka.
